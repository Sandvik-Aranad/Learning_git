# Learning_git
This is the project I am created to learning git by practicing.
So far what I learned is following.
1. git checkout -b branch_name ----------> create new branch and switch to it.
2. git branch -----------> to check the branch you are on.
3. git status -----------> check the modified file and new file changes.
4. git add . or git add file_name  ----------> adding all the modified and changed file to staging area.
5. git restore file_name or git restore . ------> unstage the all the changes.
6. git commit -m "message you want to say" -------> commit the changes to the branch
7. git push origin branch-name -------> push commit to the branch.
